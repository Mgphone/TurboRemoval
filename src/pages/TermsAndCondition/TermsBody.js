            The jurisdiction of the English courts shall apply in exclusivity
            over any claim arising from, or related to, a visit to our

          </p>
          <p>

          <p>
            Occasionally calls may be recorded for training purposes and we
            reserve the right to use these records in the unfortunate event that
            a dispute arises...
          </p>
          <h3>Fees</h3>
          <p>
            When booking with us you are booking for one trip only. If you wish
            the driver to make more than one trip for you...
          </p>
          <p>
            Customers are responsible for payment of additional monies if a
            booking exceeds the time booked for. The driver's half hourly rate
            for additional time is displayed on your quotation, and is also
            specified on the email confirmation you receive on booking.
          </p>
          <p>
            The driver will make you aware when your booking is about to exceed
            the time booked for and at that point, if you confirm that you wish
            the driver to continue and complete the booking, any additional
            monies for extra time should be paid in cash to the driver at the
            completion of the job.
          </p>
          <p>
            Customers are responsible for payment of additional monies if they
            omit a relevant stair charge from their booking and subsequently
            require the driver to carry goods up/down stairs.
          </p>
          <p>
            Customers are responsible for payment of the booking, together with
            any additional overtime payment, at the conclusion of the booking.
            Should the drivers be required to wait for that payment, their half
            hourly rate for the booking will apply for all additional time they
            are required to wait.
          </p>
          <h3>Cancellations</h3>
          <p>
            Customers are responsible for payment of the booking, together with
            any additional overtime payment, at the conclusion of the booking.
            Should the drivers be required to wait for that payment, their half
            hourly rate for the booking will apply for all additional time they
            are required to wait.
          </p>
          <p>
            There is no 'cooling off' period after booking and our cancellation
            policy applies immediately the booking is confirmed.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you cancel your booking within 24 hours of the booking due to
            start you will not be refunded any monies that have been paid.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you choose to freeze (postpone) your booking, and subsequently
            ask to cancel it at a later date, please be aware that it will be
            cancelled as per the original booking and date.
          </p>
          <p>
            You are unable to freeze (postpone) your booking on the same day
            that it is due to take place and we do require 24 hrs notice of the
            postponement of any booking. If you request to freeze your booking
            on the same day that it is due to take place, please be aware that
            this will be treated as a cancellation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Any frozen booking will need to be reactivated and used within 12
            months of the date of the booking being frozen. If your booking is
            unable to go ahead due to van size issues or other unforeseen
            problems which are outside of the driver's control, you will be
            charged a cancellation fee for the driver.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you are not present at the collection address, no person
            nominated by you is present and you are not contactable by the
            driver or by Turbo Removals will wait for 50% of the booked time
            from the designated time of the booking if the booking has been paid
            in full.
          </p>
          <p>
            If a deposit amount only has been paid, or if the booking is an 'all
            cash' booking, the driver will wait for 20 minutes from the
            designated time of the booking. No refund will be made if the driver
            has attended as booked, and waited for the requisite period of time
            before leaving the booking.
          </p>
          <p>
            If a driver attends a booking and the customer is not present, no
            person nominated by the customer is present and the customer is not
            contactable by Turbo Removals, the driver must take pictures of the
            collection/delivery address to evidence attendance. In the event of
            a subsequent dispute, the driver will rely on his photographic
            evidence to prove his attendance at the booking.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Consumer Contracts (Information, Cancellation and Additional
            Charges) Regulations 2013 are not applicable to service Contracts
            which provide for the transport of goods on a specific date or
            period for performance.
          </p>
          <h3>Toll Roads</h3>
          <p>
            The cost of any toll roads during your journey are not included
            within your online quote and would be charged additionally to your
            online quote...
          </p>
          <h3>Goods in Transit Insurance</h3>
          <p>
            Please remember any claim for damage carries a £250 excess and our
            maximum claim per item is £500. The maximum claim per booking is
            capped at £1,000.
          </p>
          <p>
            If any individual item to be moved in your booking is worth more
            than £500 you will appropriately insure the item against loss or
            damage as our liability and the driver's liability to you is capped.
            Extra insurance for high-value goods can be arranged by calling
            Turbo Removals.
          </p>
          <h3>Your Responsibilities</h3>
          <p>
            Information and other materials posted on our website are not
            intended to amount to advice upon which reliance should be placed.
            We disclaim all liability and responsibility arising from any
            reliance placed on such materials by any user of our website.
          </p>
          <h3>Van Sizes</h3>
          <p>
            It is entirely the customer’s responsibility to choose the correct
            size vehicle. Our Customer Services Team can give you all the
            relevant measurements to help you make the right choice or you can
            view our Size Guide.
          </p>
          <h3>Parking</h3>
          <p>
            Suitable parking arrangements for the driver will be made by you,
            the customer, at your own expense. These include, but are not
            limited to, suspended bays, parking permits, width restrictions and
            parking distances from your premises. You will fully indemnify the
            service provider if fines or penalties are incurred as a result of
            your failure to make said arrangements.
          </p>
          <h3>Packing</h3>
          <p>
            It is the customer’s responsibility to pack everything properly
            (unless packing services are requested). Turbo Removals does not
            accept responsibility for damage or breakage caused by poor packing.
          </p>
          <h3>Fridge freezers</h3>
          <p>
            {" "}
            It is the customer's responsibility to ensure that all fridge
            freezers are fully defrosted (Turbo Removals and its drivers are not
            liable for their contents) and all other appliances must be
            completely dry with no residual fluid;
          </p>
          <p>
            {" "}
            It is the customer's responsibility to ensure that all fridge
            freezers are fully emptied (so as to lessen the weight) and free
            from any kitchen casing/unit fitting.
          </p>
          <p>
            {" "}
            After a fridge or freezer is delivered and put in place, we suggest
            that it is left for 24 hours to settle before it is powered back on.
          </p>
          <h3>Washing Machines/Dishwasher</h3>
          <p>
            It is the customer's responsibility to un-plumb washing
            machines/dishwashers prior to our arrival. Drivers on the website
            are man and van services and not plumbers. Although they may be
            prepared to uninstall a washing machine or dishwasher, or reinstall
            a washing machine or dishwasher at your specific request, they take
            no responsibility for this. It is the customer's responsibility to
            ensure that all washing machines/dishwashers are free from any
            kitchen casing/unit fitting.
          </p>
          <h3>Access to the new Property</h3>
          <p>
            It is the customer’s responsibility to make sure that all items are
            able to be moved into the new property (for example, wardrobe, bed,
            sofa etc). We are not insured for removing any windows or making new
            entrances to the property.
          </p>
          <h3>Customer Delays</h3>
          <p>
            If any delay is caused by the customer (e.g. everything is not
            packed, waiting for keys, incorrect address, etc) our service
            providers reserve the right to add an extra cost to the final bill.
          </p>
          <h3>Changes to the Collection Time</h3>
          <p>
            If the customer wants to change the pick-up time to a confirmed
            booking we cannot guarantee availability so please contact Turbo
            Removals.
          </p>
          <h3>Completion of Booking</h3>
          <p>
            It is the customer's responsibility to check and ensure that the
            interior of the van is empty of all goods before the van leaves the
            final address listed on the booking and the booking is then
            concluded.
          </p>
          <p>
            We are not responsible for items left in the van and you agree that
            you are liable for any costs incurred by the driver in returning
            your items after a booking has been completed.
          </p>
          <h3>Customer Conduct</h3>
          <p>
            No abuse will be tolerated to our drivers or staff. If the driver is
            forced to terminate a job because of abuse from a customer, the
            customer will still be charged in full. We retain the right to
            cancel a booking in the event that the customer is abusive to our
            staff. No complaint will be handled by Turbo Removals if the
            customer is abusive to our staff.
          </p>
          <h3>Recycling Centre</h3>
          <p>
            If you require the driver to attend your local recycling centre, it
            is your responsibility to check with the centre you intend to use
            that a waste disposal licence is not required. In general, our
            drivers will not carry these. Also, please check if there will be an
            additional fee for the van entering and using the centre's
            facilities, as you will be responsible for this charge.
          </p>
          <p>
            Please note: If you require the driver to dispose of garden waste at
            a recycling centre, the waste will need to be bagged up so it is
            able to be disposed of without dirtying the interior of the van.
          </p>
          <h3>Travelling in the Van</h3>
          <p>
            Customers are able to travel in the van with the driver. Spare seats
            are based on your van size selection and the number of helpers you
            have requested. The number of seats available will be confirmed
            during your quote prior to booking. You are not charged extra to
            travel in the van and this service is offered as a courtesy by the
            driver. If you accompany the driver, you acknowledge and agree that
            this does not constitute a private hire or taxi service and you
            travel entirely at your own risk.
          </p>
          <p>
            To ensure certain standards drivers are vetted before they are
            on-boarded into our company, however, we do not accept liability for
            a driver's appearance; smoking; driving ability; manner of driving
            nor the use of inappropriate language.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition, if a service provider feels that a customer has been in
            any way rude or abusive to him, he is not compelled to carry that
            passenger in his van. In no way does travelling in the van
            constitute a private hire and the cab of the van does not constitute
            a public area. Therefore please be aware that no smoking rules do
            not apply.
          </p>
          <p>
            No refund will be given for complaints relating to you or any person
            travelling with the driver and we strongly recommend that you make
            your own travel arrangements as the driver is only required to
            complete the booking by moving your goods.
          </p>
          <p>
            Please note: The driver will not provide child car safety seats for
            any children who wish to travel in the van with an accompanying
            adult. If a customer needs a child car safety seat for a child
            travelling during the booking, the customer will need to provide
            this.
          </p>
          <h3>Stairs</h3>
          <p>
            Please note that our drivers have a stair charge if you require them
            to carry your goods up or down any flights of stairs during your
            booking. For this reason, when you book with us you are asked to
            select if there are stairs at either collection or delivery address,
            and if so, how many flights. You are provided with a drop-down box
            to select how many flights there are at each address and a flight is
            classed as anything more than 8 consecutive steps.
          </p>
          <p>
            {" "}
            Please be aware that if there is a lift that can be used to
            transport your goods, the driver's stair charge does not apply.
          </p>

          <p>
            Your privacy is very important to us and we will only distribute

            Any disputes with regards to any man and van removal related jobs or
            tasks, should be raised with Turbo Removals, in writing, so we can
            investigate fully. By using our website and booking platform you
            agree to release Turbo Removals from all claims of every nature,
            known or unknown, and we will not be connected in any way with such
            dispute.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even if we are not responsible, we will always try and help if
            something goes wrong with your booking and will try and resolve the
            problem in line with our advertised Complaints Procedure. All
            complaints should be made in writing via email to
            info@turboremovals.co.uk so that they can then be raised with the
            driver.
          </p>
          <p>
            ​ We will do everything we reasonably can to carry out our side of
            this agreement, but there may be times when we cannot perform our
            obligations because: * laws' regulations or a government authority
            stops us; * circumstances beyond our control that we cannot remedy,
            i.e. extreme weather; road closures; driver illness; failure of
            mobile networks.
          </p>

            not received within 28 days, we shall be entitled to sell the goods
            or deal with them as we think reasonable and apply any proceeds

          </p>
          <h3>Self Loading</h3>
          <p>
            If the customer chooses a self-loading service, they are solely
            liable for any damage to their items. The man and van/removal
            service will not have any involvement in the loading and unloading
            of items. Insurances will only cover your items in the event of a
            road traffic accident.
          </p>
          <h3>Equipment</h3>
          <p>
            All of our drivers carry trolleys, straps and blankets but you can
            add any additional requirements in the brief description box during
            the quote process.
          </p>
          <h3>Minimum Charge</h3>
          <p>
            No time will be refunded under any circumstances for any hours
            booked irrespective of how many hours have been used. When booking
            with Turbo Removals, you automatically make them unavailable for the
            period of time you book for and he is unable to take on any further
            bookings for that time period. He will therefore expect to receive
            full payment for that booked time.
          </p>
          <p>
            There is no refund for via stops not used. When booking a driver,
            you automatically make them unavailable for the period of time you
            book for and he is unable to take on any further bookings for that
            time period. He will therefore expect to receive full payment for
            that booked time.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you need to change the date & time of your booking and the driver
            is unavailable for the updated time, Turbo Removals will always try
            to reallocate you a new service provider for the same price.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the rare event Turbo Removals cannot reallocate you with a new
            driver, we will provide you with an updated quote from a driver who
            is available for the new time.
          </p>
          <p>
            In order to be fully refunded for your first booking, you will need
            to book the new updated quote.
          </p>
          <p>
            Failure to re-book will mean your deposit amount is non refundable.
            This will be used towards a cancellation fee for the driver who will
            have been unable to receive bookings for the time he was reserved by
            you, and administration time spent trying to recover the booking.
          </p>
          <p>
            Any remaining balances that have been paid when booking will be
            refunded without delay.
          </p>
          <p>Congestion Charge/Ultra Low Emission Zone (ULEZ)</p>
          <p>
            From 22.06.2020 the Congestion Charge will increase to £15.00 and
            operate between 07:00 and 22:00 seven days a week. The Congestion
            Charge is added to the quotes you receive if your move either begins
            or ends inside the Congestion Zone.
          </p>
          <p>
            If your booking starts or finishes in the Congestion Zone and the
            service provider's vehicle registration is older than 2005, the
            Central London Ultra Low Emission Zone (ULEZ) will also apply. The
            ULEZ Zone is in operation 24 hours a day, seven days a week, all
            year round. The service provider is responsible for payment of the
            £12.50 ULEZ charge.
          </p>
          <h3>Delays</h3>
          <p>
            All of our drivers do their very best to be on time, but there may
            be delays caused by circumstances out of our control (for example,
            weather, traffic, etc).
          </p>
          <p>
            We do not accept responsibility for any customer losses due to out
            of our control pick-up/delivery delays.
          </p>
          <h3>Payment</h3>
          <p>
            All payments made to service providers must be made in cash or by
            pre-arranged credit or debit card. Any other kind of payment must be
            agreed with Turbo Removals and made at least 5 days before moving
            day.
          </p>
          <h3>Losses/Damage</h3>
          <p>
            If you notice any damage, you must contact our office before the
            team leave the property, this is so Turbo Removals can verify the
            damage for insurance purposes. Remember that if you do not report
            damage before our team leaves the booking, we accept no liability
            for any damage.
          </p>
          <h3>Damage to Marble Goods</h3>
          <p>
            Marble goods, for example, tables or counter tops, will need to be
            protected by you prior to the booking. Although all drivers carry
            blankets, straps and a trolley as standard to move and protect your
            goods, marble is particularly fragile by nature and is liable to
            cracking and breaking due to sheer weight when moving. Over time,
            the integrity of marble is compromised and it will be vulnerable to
            damage, even with the most careful moving techniques.
          </p>
          <h3>Ikea/Argos Like products</h3>
          <p>
            Please note that Turbo Removals and its drivers will not take any
            responsibility for any damage or breakages involving any Ikea or
            Argos products of any type. This is due to the poor standard of
            construction and the one-off build design of their products. Flat
            pack furniture of any kind should not be disassembled as this can
            weaken the item and cause damage during transport.
          </p>
          <h3>Damage to Televisions/PCs/Monitors</h3>
          <p>
            Please note that Turbo Removals and its drivers will not take any
            responsibility for any internal damage to a television/PC or Monitor
            without clear evidence of external damage to the television/PC or
            Monitor. This will include but is not exclusive to:
            <span>
              * backlight 'bleeding'; * colour banding or bleeding; * clouding
              of the screen; or * pixel damage.{" "}
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Due to the sensitive nature of televisions/computer equipment,
            without clear evidence of external damage, it is impossible to prove
            who caused any internal damage.
          </p>
          <h3>European Moves</h3>
          <p>
            On international moves payment must be made before the van is
            unloaded at the destination and there are no exemptions from this
            rule. We reserve the right to levy any extra charges or withhold
            delivery of goods until full payment plus any extra charges are
            settled in full.
          </p>
          <h3>Adherence to terms</h3>
          <p>
            The customer agrees that within English law no complaints or
            testimonials on any platform maybe left against either the company
            or service provider if the complaint is clearly covered within our
            Terms and Conditions.
          </p>
          <p>
            The customer also agrees that should a complaint or claim be made
            that they allow good time for the company or service provider to
            answer the complaint or claim.
          </p>
          <p>
            The customer agrees that should Turbo Removals be unable to
            ascertain the truth behind a matter that the customer agrees to any
            moderation that the companies deems necessary to settle the claim.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the event of a negative third party review being left, we reserve
            the right to answer that review on any social media channel.
