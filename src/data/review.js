      "I booked 3 men and a van and they were extremely helpful and efficient.,getting my house move completed in good time. I booked for 5 hours, but two trips were needed, and I'm glad I paid for more than their estimate of time required, having read other comments. I only had 2 days notice to move, so the extra time was needed due to us still packing, and not down to the men. Very happy, thank you!",

      "Excellent and professional service from start to finish. We had a long delay on completion day and they kindly waited for us, plus doing multiple trips to ensure all our belongings moved with us. Stop paying 1000s of pounds for those 'house moving' company and book these wonderful guys instead!",

      "I cannot fault our driver. He was impeccable. Considering we were looking at emplying a moving company initially this was a much more cost effective option and made this, although harder manually, a much better experience. ",

      "Nawarat kindly stepped in at the last minute when our original driver had to cancel. It was not an easy move with lots of stairs and large items going through narrow spaces. Nawarat made it all seem incredibly easy and he was fast, friendly and efficient. Would not hesitate to recommend him, fantastic driver. He was also considerate and wore a mask and gloves when moving our items to align with social distancing measures.",
